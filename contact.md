We are a network of security researchers who mainly work online. In the future, we may develop a contact point for receiving vulnerability reports, but for the moment, we already have enough of our own. If you want to contact us for any other matters, you can send us an e mail to "question" at divd nl. Most likely, our chairman Victor will answer, or forward your mail to Chris or Astrid. You can also meet us at cyber security conferences and hacker events or just follow us in Twitter.
